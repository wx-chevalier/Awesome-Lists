- [2022-A Gentle Introduction to Assembly Language Programming》📚](https://github.com/pkivolowitz/asm_book): This textbook provides a gentle introduction to assembly language programming. What makes this introduction "gentle" is that it assumes the reader is already comfortable with C or C++ coding. We use this assumed knowledge to bridge backward towards the low level ISA (Instruction Set Architecture).
