Not running Selenium or Chromimum saves you like half a gig of ram :/

Our mission is to provide a robust and ready-to-use API for seamless communication with WhatsApp. The server is designed to streamline the process of sending and receiving messages, managing contacts, creating groups, and much more, all while leveraging the power of JavaScript ES6, NodeJS, and a RESTful architecture.

The WhatsApp API client connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app, accessing its internal functions. This grants you access to nearly all the features available on WhatsApp Web, enabling dynamic handling similar to any other Node.js application.
